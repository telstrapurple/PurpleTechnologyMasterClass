Welcome tech lovers far and wide! Weâ€™re an online tech enthusiast group facilitated by Telstra Purple hosting live technical workshops on a range of tech topics.
You can join us on one of our live streams with Len Webel your host from Telstra Purple and a - co-host - technical expert from the multitude of super knowledgeable people we work with to guide us through the workshop.

This is a group for anyone interested in learning about technology in a hands-on way.

Why this group?
We started this group to share the vastness of knowledge that we have accumulated over the years working on amazing projects like Airspeeder, Autonomous vehicles with FMG, digital twin solutions for a number of high profile resource clients, financial software for agriculture, banking, health SaaS, you name it we have done it.
